### **🎯 Objective**

Establish tightly coordinated contributor pods called **REP Squads** to systemize content creation, synchronized amplification, and consistent REP growth across the Sui ecosystem. Each squad will act as a self-managed micro-team focused on increasing collective and individual impact via content aligned with ecosystem goals.

---

### **🧠 Concept: REP Squads**

REP Squads are small, theme-based pods of creators that co-create and cross-amplify Sui ecosystem content to drive:

* Rapid individual REP growth through consistent GiveRep tagging

* Higher engagement through networked cross-promotion

* Collective visibility of the FirstMovers brand

* Greater ecosystem coverage via diversified content formats

### **🏗️ Structure**

| Role | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Squad Lead | Sets weekly themes, ensures output, reviews REP tags |
| Pod Members | 3–4 contributors per squad, each producing 1–2 content pieces/week |
| Support | Shared Notion dashboard for planning, tagging, and tracking |

| **Monday** | Squad Lead shares theme/topic of the week (e.g., Suiet onboarding tips) |
| **Tue–Thu** | Content drafting, feedback sharing, publishing begins |
| **Friday** | Synchronized posting \+ tagging: @giverep, @firstmovers, project handles |
| **Saturday** | Internal squad shoutouts \+ squad leaderboard updates |
| **Sunday** | Squad sync-up \+ planning for next topic |

### **📈 Expected Outcomes**

| Metric | Individual Impact | Squad/Collective Impact |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| REP Growth | Higher frequency of REP via tagging | Reputation as top REP-generating cohort |
| Content Engagement | 3–5x increase via synchronized drops | Amplified ecosystem visibility |
| Recognition & Outreach | Inbound collabs, DMs from projects | Establish FirstMovers as trusted node |

* **Squad Comm Channels:** Group chat per squad (Telegram/Discord)

---

### **🔑 Activation Checklist**

### **🧠 Long-Term Vision**

REP Squads are not just content pods — they are **mini KoLs in training**.  
 Each pod becomes an engine of influence, REP, and ecosystem storytelling.  
 Over time, the best-performing squads will evolve into:

* REP Grant recipients

* Project-specific amplification teams

* Ecosystem onboarding squads

* Frontline faces of FirstMovers’ voice in Sui
