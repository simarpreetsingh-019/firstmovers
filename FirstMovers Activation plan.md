## 📄 Proposal: Strategy Plan 2 – Rapid REP Engine

 **Submitted by:** *Simarpreet Singh*

 **Goal:** Rapidly grow contributor REP(GiveRep) and ecosystem impact via modular, high-output content strategies.

---

### **🎯 Objective**

Leverage two powerful frameworks to maximize content reach, contributor REP, and ecosystem integration:

1. **REP Squads (Creator Pods)** – Coordinated content amplification

2. **REP x Bounty Board** – Targeted campaign execution in collaboration with Sui ecosystem projects

---

### **🔧 Phase Breakdown**

## Phase 1: REP Squads – Creator Pods for Amplification

### Structure:

* 3–5 pods categorized by content style (Threads, Videos, Blogs, Memes)

* 4–5 contributors per pod

* 1 Squad Lead per pod

#### 

#### Weekly Flow:

| Day | Activity |
| ----- | ----- |
| Monday | Weekly topic drop (e.g., \#SuietTips, the latest loyalty program bounty) |
| Tue–Thu | Content creation & posting |
| Friday | Cross-pod amplification( Group actively engaging and sharing REPs) |
| Saturday | Leaderboard & highlights |
| Sunday | Squad sync, next week planning |

#### Expected ROI:

* 3x–5x average engagement boost per post

* Accelerated individual REP growth via @giverep tags

* Improved social credibility for contributors

* **FirstMovers recognized as a Sui-native creator collective**

---

## Phase 2: REP x Bounty Board – Project-Facing Campaigns

#### Setup:

* Simple bounty board hosted via Notion or Dework

* Campaign types:

  * 🧪 Try & Review (e.g., product demos)

  * 📚 Educate & Explain (e.g., tutorials)

  * 📊 Compare & Analyze (e.g., feature comparisons)

  * 🔁 Amplify & React (e.g., reaction videos, memes)

### Execution:

* Launch test bounties internally using Sui-native tools

* Once validated, onboard external projects to list public bounties

* Tag ecosystem handles \+ @giverep \+ use \#FirstMoversREP for tracking
